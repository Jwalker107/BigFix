&lt;P&gt;This&amp;nbsp;Analysis retrieves results of&amp;nbsp;a filesystem scan to attempt detecting Apache Commons Text versions that may be vulnerable to one of the following vulnerabilty CVE-2022-42889 reported in October 2022:&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"&gt;This Analysis attempts to detect the presence and versions of Apache Commons Text java library, without distinction between vulnerable or updated versions.&amp;nbsp; These results should be considered only a starting point in determining whether a system is actually vulnerable, along with other information such as the version of Java Virtual Machine and specific application or code configurations as referenced in the security bulletins above.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;</Description>
